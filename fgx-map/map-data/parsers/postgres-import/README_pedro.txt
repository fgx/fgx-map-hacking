Yo gral..

The idea is to remove globals,
but at the same time create and object which will crash 

The trick is 

We need to create an "object" some how..

so yaml prodides some "dict nested" 
eg
nav_aids =  = yaml.load(navaid.yaml)
then we have to do...
for foo in nav_aids['data']['x']

we type cast into and object..
Import sequence ==

Its not a drop create, its a sequence..

So we push raaw adata



so its
OB =  FGxOO(python_dic)
